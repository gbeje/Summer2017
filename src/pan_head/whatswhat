_node: baxter moves screen towards closest object its front sonars detect. scrolling window, expiration
changes relative to _node: 

_expire: if too much time elapses between current minimum's timestamp and most recent message timestamp, then the current minimum gets reset and finding a minimum starts over (copy of _node)

_smallarray: array only holds distances from front sonars. finding minimum (unexpired) from the array instead of starting over if the current minimum expires
